# Finding MCUs by pinouts
One of the easiest ways to identify a microcontroller is by its power bus layouts.

This document needs to be converted into a database, and a tool should be written to find matches by pins.

## SOIC and DIP

### Atmel ATtiny 13,25,45,85
GND the last pin on the first row, VCC the last pin. 

### Atmel ATtiny 44/84, ATtinyX12, ATtinyX14, ATtinyX24
